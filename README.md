# ðŸŽŒ MyAnimeList Score of Modern Anime Prediction

This project explores the problem of predicting MyAnimeList score of anime released over the period 2015-2024 based on their features. Data was collected from [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net) using [Jikan](https://jikan.moe/) API. Several predictive models (MLR, Regularized Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost) were built and analyzed in order to answer this question.

The project was completed as part of the **JSC370: Introduction to Data Science** course at the University of Toronto (Winter 2025).
